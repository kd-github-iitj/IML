So to create an environment named "j1.8" in Julia:

I open the terminal.
then typed the following command: conda create -n j1.8
now activated the environment by entering: conda activate j1.8 then,
Install Julia version 1.8 by running: conda install julia=1.8.
now we will be using the Plots package for this code. To add it, follow these steps:

Run Julia in the terminal.
Type using Pkg to import the Pkg module.
Run Pkg.add("Plots") to install the Plots package.
All the plots generated by the code will be saved in the "pictures" folder.
